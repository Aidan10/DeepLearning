ML/AI practice and competitions - Projects that I find interesting


### Some Projects that I wish to work on

- [x] Bidirectional LSTM for timeseries data
- [x] Capsule Network Implementation for Image classification - try multiple viewing angles
- [x] CNN - mnist
- [ ] GAN
- [ ] Various DeepAutoencoders (Variational, )
- [x] 2D U-Net for Image Segmentation
- [ ] 3D U-Net for 3D tomogrpahy of P-FIB/SEM image stacks
